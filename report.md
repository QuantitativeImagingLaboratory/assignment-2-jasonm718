DFT
    Made four for loops to account for the summations. The only real difference between
    the function was the exponential parts, which varied.
. Fourier transform
. Inverse Fourier transform
. Discrete Cosine transform
    - Did not contain a complex part.
. Magnitude of DFT
    - Took the abs value of f(u,v)




Frequency Filtering

. Mask
    - The masks vairations where similar between high and low. The difference
    between them came upon the relevance of the cutoff and how it was applied.

. Filtering
    - Applied masks by multiplying them to the shiftted forward fourier transform.

. Full scale contrast stretch
    - I did not need to take the negative. Used max-min contrast stretch algorithm.
